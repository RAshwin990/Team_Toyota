# Introduction:
In this project, an Anti Lock Braking System is designed and developed using MATLAB and SIMULINK.

# Objective:
The main objective of this project is to design and simulate a ABS system for vehicle safety.

# Features:
The following are the features of this project:

1. To prevent locking of wheeels during hard braking.

# 4W's and 1H:
## Why:
1. To design and simulate a ABS system for vehicle safety.

## Where:
1. This model can be deployed in any vehicle that requires a anti lock braking system.
2. This can also be used as a basic Anti Lock Braking system that can devopled into a more advanced system.

## Who:
1. This model can be used by any vehicle manufacturer.

## When:
1. This model can be deployed when a manufacturer needs a ABS systen to add safety to it's product.

## How:
1. By fitting this ABS module to it's vehicles, The manufacturer can add a safety feature.
2. It will be useful to store all the data of the employees.

# SWOT Analysis:

## Strengths:
1. It can measure the speed of the wheels.
2. It can prevent the wheels locking.
3. It can measure the distance taken to stop the vechicle.

## Weakness:
1. Very basic UI and functions.

## Opportunities:
1. A better, more intuitive GUI can be developed for this system.
2. It can be made more advanced.

## Threats:
1. More advanced and sofisticated systems are already available in the market.
