# Introduction:
In this project, The Automatic Climate Control System is designed and developed using MATLAB and SIMULINK.

# Objective:
The main objective of this project is to design and simulate a Automatic Climate Control System is to maintain user set temperature environment.

# Features:
The following are the features of this project:

1. A car with a manual air conditioning system requires you to manually toggle the AC, control the blower speed and temperature settings.whereas in automatic ,no need to worry about it.
2. Multi-zone Climate Control
3. Air Purifiers and Perfumes

# 4W's and 1H:
## Why:

1. To design and simulate a Automatic Climate Control System to maintain user set temperature environment.

## Where:
1. The system can be used in industrial and commercial vechicles and workareas.

## Who:
1. This model can be used by any vehicle manufacturer.

## When:
1. This model can be deployed when a manufacturer needs a Automatic Climate Control System to it's product.

## How:
1. By fitting this climate module to it's vehicles, The manufacturer can add a feature to thier product vehicles.
2. you can connect extra light to the control which improves ambience.

# SWOT Analysis:

## Strengths:
1. it can improve convinience
2. it can connect technologies
3. it can save Multi-zone Climate Control. 

## Weakness:
1. Cost is high to fix or refubish.

## Opportunities:
1. A combination of features can be added to improve its value by adding light control to it.
2. By adding music control to it.

## Threats:
1. More advanced and sofisticated systems are already available in the market of expensive cars.
