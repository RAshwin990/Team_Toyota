# Introduction:
In this project, a Adaptive Cruise Control System is designed and developed using MATLAB and SIMULINK.

# Objective:
The main objective of this project is to design and simulate a ACC system for vehicle.

# Features:
The following are the features of this project:

1. To prevent accidents and to control the speed of the car autonomously .

# 4W's and 1H:
## Why:
1. To design and simulate a ACC system for vehicle.

## Where:
1. This model can be deployed in any vehicle that requires a adaptive Cruise Control system.
2. This can also be used as a basic Cruise Control system that can devopled into a more advanced Autonomous Car system.

## Who:
1. This model can be used by any vehicle manufacturer.

## When:
1. This model can be deployed when a manufacturer needs a ACC systen to add autonomous speed contol to it's product.

## How:
1. By fitting this ACCS module to it's vehicles, The manufacturer can add a autonomous speed control feature.
2. It will be useful to store all the data of the car.

# SWOT Analysis:

## Strengths:
1. It can measure the speed of the wheels.
2. It can prevent the accidents.
3. It can measure the distance taken to stop the vechicle.

## Weakness:
1. Very basic UI and functions.

## Opportunities:
1. A better, more intuitive GUI can be developed for this system.
2. It can be made more advanced.

## Threats:
1. More advanced and sofisticated systems are already available in the market.
